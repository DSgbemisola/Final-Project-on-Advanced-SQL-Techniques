# Final-Project-on-Advanced-SQL-Techniques

This is a hands-on Project on Advanced SQL Techniques. 

# Software Used in this Lab
PgAdmin 4 (PostgreSQL 15)

# Objectives
The objectives of this project were to:

1. Use joins to query data from multiple tables

2. Create and query views

3. Write and run stored procedures

4. Use transactions

# Database Used in this Lab
The Three (3) datasets used in this project were gotten from the city of Chicagoâ€™s Data Portal:

Dataset 1 - Socioeconomic Indicators in Chicago

Dataset 2 - Chicago Public Schools

Dataset 3 - Chicago Crime Data

# Task A: Creating the Chicago database and the 3 datasets as tables in PgAdmin.

a. The new database named "ChicagoDB" was created in PgAdmin and the 3 tables were created by executing the following scripts rather than creating each table manually by typing the DDL commands in the SQL editor.

1.Chicago_public_schools_create_query_script: https://drive.google.com/file/d/114CoSCeFcSDzOLuS9FWUeIdY3iLKoN8A/view?usp=sharing

2.Chicago_crime_create_query_script: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1C3O8Aa47rka9L2LK0mQF5eQLvz3fXY7Z/view?usp=sharing

3.Chicago_socioeconomic_create_query_script: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AoLeFsOOvERw1PNYBHmXUJQ18DxCqtx9/view?usp=sharing

b. After the 3 tables had been successfully created within the Chicago database, The 3 datasets were downloaded and imported into the already created tables as CSV files.

1. Chicago_public_schools_data - file can be downloaded here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vUT6RHg869rMTiy0ML-vWuyPW7fRu2m9/view?usp=sharing

2. Chicago_crime_data - file can be downloaded here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o30Anam0IZXfAFVZQwdxMDIKeW87YES_/view?usp=sharing

3. Chicago_socioeconomic_data - file can be downloaded here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FLKT0IhsQzxL89PIsRGv10bHCCl0qbVj/view?usp=sharing

To load each table, the following steps were taken:

1. Right-click on each table and select Import tab.

2. ChoOse the csv file and click OK 

3. The dataset was loaded

4. The above steps were repeated to load the other 2 datasets 

# Task B: Exploring the Tables

In exploring the tables within the database, the table was selected to view the First 100 Rows.
